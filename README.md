## Basics
Here we cover the basics of PyTorch, from tensors and automatic differentiation to building and trainig a simple Neural Network with datasets integrated with PyTorch.
  - autoDiff - automatic differentiation with torch.autograd
  - buildNN - building a neural network to classify images in the FashionMNIST dataset
  - datasets&dataloaders - creating custom dataset class and loading it for training/validation

## Classifier
Training an image classification with resnet18 backbone and using TensorBoard for train monitoring.
